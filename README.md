# Spotify Playlist Maker
## A small React project that searches spotify and allows playlist creation

# Getting Started
1. Download the project and use a terminal to navigate to the /spotifyPlaylistMaker folder
2. type `npm install`
3. Open the folder in your preferred editor and navigate to src/util/apiKey.js
4. And inside the variable at the top of the file `const clientID = ' '` and inside the empty string enter your spotify developer client ID
5. In your terminal type `npm start` within the project folder. This will start the react local server and open your browser to localhost:3000
6. Play around with it!

# Current issues
1. The web app cannot be hosted due to a refresh error I'm trying to solve.
2. When the 'search' button is used it will fail initially, re-entering the search and clicking again will make it function.

# Planned Updates
1. Filter support for results
2. Album/Artist images with results
3. 'Total Playtime' information on created playlist
